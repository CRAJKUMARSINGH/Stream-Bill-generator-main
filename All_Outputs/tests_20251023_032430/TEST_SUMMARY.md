# Test Run Summary

- Date: 2025-10-23 03:24 UTC
- Runner: pytest 8.4.2 on Python 3.13.3
- Suite: 58 tests
- Result: 55 passed, 1 failed, 2 errors
- JUnit XML: `All_Outputs/tests_20251023_032430/junit.xml`
- Full log: `All_Outputs/tests_20251023_032430/pytest.log`

## Failures
- test_pdfkit.py::test_pdfkit — wkhtmltopdf not found (pdfkit requires external binary)

## Errors
- test_all_batch_files.py::test_batch_file_syntax — missing fixture `file_path`
- test_all_batch_files.py::test_batch_file_execution — missing fixture `file_path`

## Notes
- Most functional tests passed, including template rendering, deployment checks, and integration modules.
- Installing `wkhtmltopdf` would likely resolve the pdfkit failure. The apt package was unavailable in this environment; alternative install may be required or skip the test.
- The batch file tests appear to be written as parameterized tests but without a fixture definition. Consider refactoring to iterate over discovered `.bat` files or add a fixture.
