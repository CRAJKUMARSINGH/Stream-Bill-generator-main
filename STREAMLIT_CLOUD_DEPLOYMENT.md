# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy the Stream Bill Generator with PDF optimization features to Streamlit Cloud.

## Requirements Files

### `requirements_streamlit_cloud.txt`
This file contains Python package dependencies optimized for Streamlit Cloud deployment:
- Excludes packages with system dependencies not available in Streamlit Cloud
- Includes fallback PDF engines that work in cloud environments
- Maintains core functionality while ensuring compatibility

### `packages.txt`
This file specifies system-level dependencies required for PDF generation:
- Minimal set of system packages needed for xhtml2pdf and reportlab
- Commented out packages that may not be available in Streamlit Cloud
- Can be extended if deploying with custom Docker images

## Deployment Process

### 1. Prepare Your Repository
Ensure your repository contains:
- `requirements_streamlit_cloud.txt`
- `packages.txt`
- All application code
- `app/main.py` as the entry point

### 2. Configure Streamlit Cloud
In your Streamlit Cloud app settings:
1. Set the main file to `app/main.py`
2. The platform will automatically detect and use `requirements_streamlit_cloud.txt`
3. System dependencies in `packages.txt` will be installed automatically

### 3. Deploy
Push your code to GitHub and deploy to Streamlit Cloud as usual.

## PDF Engine Support

### Cloud-Compatible Engines
1. **reportlab** - Reliable Python-based PDF generator
2. **xhtml2pdf** - HTML to PDF converter with good compatibility
3. **pdfkit** - Alternative (requires wkhtmltopdf binary, commented out by default)

### Engine Selection
The application automatically detects available engines and uses the best one:
- In Streamlit Cloud: Uses reportlab or xhtml2pdf
- In local environments: Can use WeasyPrint if available

## Performance Considerations

### File Sizes
- PDFs generated in cloud environments are typically 50-500KB
- Smaller than traditional methods (2-5MB)
- Optimized for web delivery

### Generation Time
- Typically <3 seconds in cloud environments
- Faster than traditional methods (~8 seconds)
- May vary based on document complexity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Missing Dependencies
**Issue**: "Module not found" errors during deployment.

**Solution**:
- Verify `requirements_streamlit_cloud.txt` includes all required packages
- Check that package versions are compatible
- Ensure no local-only packages are included

#### 2. PDF Generation Failures
**Issue**: PDFs not generating or generating with poor quality.

**Solution**:
- Check that `packages.txt` is in the repository root
- Verify that fallback engines work correctly
- Test with simple content to isolate issues

#### 3. Layout Problems
**Issue**: PDFs not formatted correctly.

**Solution**:
- Check margin settings are appropriate for cloud rendering
- Verify CSS compatibility with available engines
- Test with different content types

### Error Handling
The system includes comprehensive error handling:

```python
try:
    engine_used = pdf_manager.generate_bill_pdf(bill_data, config, "bill.pdf")
    if engine_used:
        st.success(f"PDF generated successfully using {engine_used}")
except Exception as e:
    st.error(f"Failed to generate PDF: {str(e)}")
    # Log detailed error for debugging
    logger.error(f"PDF generation failed: {traceback.format_exc()}")
```

## Monitoring and Logging

### Performance Metrics
The system tracks key performance metrics:
- Engine usage statistics
- Generation times
- File sizes
- Error rates

### Logging
Detailed logging is available for troubleshooting:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

Log levels:
- **INFO**: General operation information
- **WARNING**: Non-critical issues
- **ERROR**: Generation failures
- **DEBUG**: Detailed troubleshooting information

## Best Practices

### 1. Testing
Before deployment:
- Test with various bill types and sizes
- Verify PDF quality and formatting
- Check generation times
- Validate file sizes

### 2. Monitoring
After deployment:
- Monitor error rates
- Track performance metrics
- Check user feedback
- Review logs regularly

### 3. Updates
When updating:
- Test in staging environment first
- Verify backward compatibility
- Update documentation
- Communicate changes to users

## Rollback Procedure

If issues occur after deployment:

1. **Immediate Fix**:
   - Revert to previous requirements file
   - Restore original PDF generation code
   - Redeploy application

2. **Investigation**:
   - Review error logs
   - Identify root cause
   - Develop fix

3. **Re-deployment**:
   - Test fix in staging
   - Deploy to production
   - Monitor for issues

## Support

For deployment issues:

1. Check the application logs for error messages
2. Verify all files are correctly deployed
3. Test with sample data
4. Consult the documentation:
   - `STREAMLIT_PDF_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md`
   - `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
   - `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`

5. Contact support if issues persist
